1.  Introduction

   WARP Streaming Format (WARP) is a media format designed to deliver
   CMAF [CMAF] and LOC [LOC] compliant media content over Media Over
   QUIC Transport (MOQT) [MoQTransport].  WARP works by fragmenting the
   bitstream into objects that can be independently transmitted.  WARP
   leverages the Common Catalog Format [COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT] to
   describe the output of the original publisher.  WARP specifies how
   content should be packaged and signaled, defines how the catalog
   communicates the content, specifies prioritization strategies for
   real-time and workflows for beginning and terminating broadcasts.
   WARP also details how end-subscribers may perform adaptive bitrate
   switching.  WARP is targeted at real-time and interactive levels of
   live latency.

   This document describes version 1 of the streaming format.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the conventions detailed in Section 1.3 of
   [RFC9000] when describing the binary encoding.

3.  Media packaging

   WARP delivers CMAF [CMAF] and LOC [LOC] packaged media bitstreams.
   Either format may be used in a broadcast, or they may be intermixed
   between tracks.  The packaging format of a track, once declared, MUST
   remain constant.

3.1.  CMAF packaging

   This specification references [CMAFpackaging] to define how CMAF
   packaged bitstreams are mapped to [MoQTransport] groups and objects.

   Both CMAF Object mappings [CMAFpackaging] Section 4 are supported and
   a content producer may use either.  To identify to clients which
   object mapping mode is being used for a given Track, the catalog
   "packaging" field MUST use one of the values defined in Table 1.  The
   values are case-sensitive.

   Table 1 provides values for the catalog "packaging" field with CMAF
   packaging.

    +=======================+=================+=======================+
    | Packaging field value | Condition       | Explanation           |
    +=======================+=================+=======================+
    | cmaf-frag-per-group   | [CMAFpackaging] | Each CMAF Fragment is |
    |                       | 4.1 is active   | placed in a single    |
    |                       |                 | MOQT Object and there |
    |                       |                 | is one MOQT Object    |
    |                       |                 | per MOQT Group        |
    +-----------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+
    | cmaf-chunk-per-object | [CMAFpackaging] | Each CMAF chunk is    |
    |                       | 4.2 is active   | placed in a MOQT      |
    |                       |                 | Object and there is   |
    |                       |                 | one MOQT Group per    |
    |                       |                 | CMAF Fragment         |
    +-----------------------+-----------------+-----------------------+

                                  Table 1

3.2.  LOC packaging

   This specification references Low Overhead Container (LOC) [LOC] to
   define how audio and video content is packaged.  With this packaging
   mode, each EncodedAudioChunk or EncodedVideoChunk sample is placed in
   a separate MOQT Object.  Samples that belong to the same Group of
   Pictures (GOP) MUST be placed within the same MOQT Group.

   Table 2 provides values for the catalog "packaging" field with LOC
   packaging.

    +=============+================+==================================+
    | Packaging   | Condition      | Explanation                      |
    | field value |                |                                  |
    +=============+================+==================================+
    | loc         | [LOC] packagin | Each EncodedAudioChunk or        |
    |             | is active      | EncodedVideoChunk sample is      |
    |             |                | placed in a separate MOQT Object |
    +-------------+----------------+----------------------------------+

                                  Table 2

3.3.  Time-alignment

   WARP Tracks MAY be time-aligned.  Those that are, are subject to the
   following requirements:

   *  Time-aligned tracks MUST be advertised in the catalog as belonging
      to a common render group.

   *  The presentation time of the first media sample contained within
      the first MOQT Object of each equally numbered MOQT Group MUST be
      identical.

   A consequence of this restriction is that a WARP receiver SHOULD be
   able to cleanly switch between time-aligned media tracks at group
   boundaries.

3.4.  Content protection and encryption

   The catalog and media object payloads MAY be encrypted.  Common
   Encryption [CENC] with 'cbcs' mode (AES CBC with pattern encryption)
   is the RECOMMENDED encryption method for CMAF packaged content.

   ToDo - details of how keys are exchanged and license servers
   signaled.  May be best to extend catalog spec to allow the
   specification of content protection schema, along with any pssh or
   protection initialization data.

   ToDo - content protection for LOC-packaged content.

4.  Catalog

   WARP uses the Common Catalog Format {[COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT}} to
   describe the content being produced by a publisher.

   Per Sect 5.1 of [COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT], WARP registers an entry in
   the "MoQ Streaming Format Type" table.  The type value is 0x001, the
   name is "WARP Streaming Format" and the RFC is XXX.

   Every WARP catalog MUST declare a streaming format type (See Sect
   3.2.1 of [COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT]) value of 1.

   Every WARP catalog MUST declare a streaming format version (See Sect
   3.2.1 of [COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT]) corresponding to the version of
   this document.

   The catalog track MUST have a track name of "catalog".  A catalog
   object MAY be independent of other catalog objects or it MAY
   represent a delta update of a prior catalog object.  The first
   catalog object published within a new group MUST be independent.  A
   catalog object SHOULD only be published only when the availability of
   tracks changes.

   Each catalog update MUST be mapped to a discreet MOQT Object.

5.  Media transmission

   The MOQT Groups and MOQT Objects need to be mapped to MOQT Streams.
   Irrespective of the Section 3 in place, each MOQT Object MUST be
   mapped to a new MOQT Stream.

6.  Workflow

   A WARP publisher MUST publish a catalog track object before
   publishing any media track objects.

   At the completion of a session, a publisher MUST publish a catalog
   update that removes all currently active tracks.  This action SHOULD
   be interpreted by receivers to mean that the publish session is
   complete.

7.  Security Considerations

   ToDo

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new entry in the "MoQ Streaming Format"
   Registry (see [MoQTransport] Sect 8).  The type value is 0x001, the
   name is "WARP Streaming Format" and the RFC is XXX.
