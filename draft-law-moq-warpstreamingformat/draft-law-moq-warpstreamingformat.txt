1.  Introduction

   WARP Streaming Format (WARP) is a media format designed to deliver
   CMAF [CMAF] compliant media content over Media Over QUIC Transport
   (MOQT) [MoQTransport].  WARP works by fragmenting the bitstream into
   objects that can be independently transmitted.  WARP leverages a
   simple prioritization strategy of assigning newer content a higher
   delivery order, allowing intermediaries to drop older data, and video
   over audio, in the face of congestion.  Either complete Groups of
   Pictures (GOPS) [ISOBMFF] or individual frames are mapped to
   MoQTransport Objects.  WARP is targeted at interactive levels of live
   latency.

   This document describes version 1 of the streaming format.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the conventions detailed in Section 1.3 of
   [RFC9000] when describing the binary encoding.

3.  Media packaging

   WARP delivers CMAF-packaged media bitstreams.  This specification
   references [CMAFpackaging] to define how CMAF packaged bitstreams are
   mapped to [MoQTransport] groups and objects.

   Both CMAF Object mappings [CMAFpackaging] Section 4 are supported and
   a content producer may use either.  To identify to consumers which
   object mapping mode is being used for a given Track, a new track
   field is defined as per table 1.

   +===========+================+========+========+======+============+
   | Field     | Name           |Required|Location|JSON  | Definition |
   |           |                |        |        |type  |            |

                                 Table 1

3.1.  Packaging mode

   The packaging mode value is defined by Table 2.

    |                  |                 | Fragment                   |
    +------------------+-----------------+----------------------------+

                                  Table 2

3.2.  Time-alignment

   WARP Tracks MAY be time-aligned.  Those that are, are subject to the
   following requirements:

   *  Time-aligned tracks MUST be advertised in the catalog as belonging
      to a common render group.

   *  The presentation time of the first media sample contained within
      the first MOQT Object of each equally numbered MOQT Group MUST be
      identical.

   A consequence of this restriction is that a WARP receiver SHOULD be
   able to cleanly switch between time-aligned media tracks at group
   boundaries.

3.3.  Content protection and encryption

   The catalog and media object payloads MAY be encrypted.  Common
   Encryption [CENC] with 'cbcs' mode (AES CBC with pattern encryption)
   is the RECOMMENDED encryption method.

   ToDo - details of how keys are exchanged and license servers
   signaled.  May be best to extend catalog spec to allow the
   specification of content protection schema, along with any pssh or
   protection initialization data.

4.  Catalog

   WARP uses the Common Catalog Format {[COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT}} to
   describe the content being produced by a publisher.

   Per Sect 5.1 of [COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT], WARP registers an entry in
   the "MoQ Streaming Format Type" table.  The type value is 0x001, the
   name is "WARP Streaming Format" and the RFC is XXX.

   Every WARP catalog MUST declare a streaming format type (See Sect
   3.2.1 of [COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT]) value of 1.

   Every WARP catalog MUST declare a streaming format version (See Sect
   3.2.1 of [COMMON-CATALOG-FORMAT]) corresponding to the version of
   this document.

   The catalog track MUST have a track name of "catalog".  A catalog
   object MAY be independent of other catalog objects or it MAY
   represent a delta update of a prior catalog object.  The first
   catalog object published within a new group MUST be independent.  A
   catalog object SHOULD only be published only when the availability of
   tracks changes.

   Each catalog update MUST be mapped to a discreet moq-transport
   object.

5.  Media transmission

   The MOQT Groups and MOQT Objects need to be mapped to moq-transport
   Streams.  Irrespective of the Section 3.1 in place, each MOQT Object
   MUST be mapped to a new moq-transport Stream.

6.  Workflow

   A WARP publisher MUST publish a catalog track object before
   publishing any media track objects.

   At the completion of a session, a publisher MUST publish a catalog
   update that removes all currently active tracks.  This action SHOULD
   be interpreted by receivers to mean that the publish session is
   complete.

7.  Security Considerations

   ToDo

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document creates a new entry in the "MoQ Streaming Format"
   Registry (see [MoQTransport] Sect 8).  The type value is 0x001, the
   name is "WARP Streaming Format" and the RFC is XXX.
