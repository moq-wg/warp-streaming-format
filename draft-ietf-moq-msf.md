# Introduction

MOQT Streaming Format (MSF) is a media format designed to deliver LOC {{LOC}}
compliant media content over Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) {{MoQTransport}}.
MSF works by fragmenting the bitstream into objects that can be independently
transmitted. MSF leverages a catalog format to describe the output of the
original publisher. MSF specifies how content should be packaged and signaled,
defines how the catalog communicates the content, specifies prioritization
strategies for real-time and workflows for beginning and terminating broadcasts.
MSF also details how end-subscribers may perform adaptive bitrate switching.
MSF is targeted at real-time and interactive levels of live latency, as well as
VOD content.

This document describes version 1 of the streaming format.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the conventions detailed in Section 1.3 of {{RFC9000}} when
describing the binary encoding.

# Scope

The purpose of MSF is to provide an interoperable media streaming format
operating over {{MoQTransport}}. Interoperability implies that:

* An original publisher can package incoming media content into tracks, prepare
  a catalog and announce the availability of the content to an MOQT relay. Media
  content refers to audio and video data, as well as ancillary data such as
  captions, subtitles, accessibility and other timed-text data.
* An MOQT relay can process the announcement as well as cache and propagate the
  tracks, both to other relays or to the final subscriber.
* A final subscriber can parse the catalog, request tracks, decode and render
  the received media data.

MSF is intended to provide a format for delivering commercial media content. To
that end, the following features are within scope:

* Video codecs - all codecs supported by {{LOC}}
* Audio codecs  - all audio codecs supported by {{LOC}}
* Catalog track - describes the availability and characteristics of content
  produced by the original publisher.
* Timeline track - describes the relationship between MOQT Group and Object IDs
  to media time.
* Token-based authorization and access control
* Captions + Subtitles - support for {{WEBVTT}} and {{IMSC1}} transmission
* Latency support across multiple regimes (thresholds are informative only and
  describe the delay between the original publisher placing the content on the
  wire and the final subscriber rendering it)
 * Real-time - less than 500ms
 * Interactive - between 500ms and 2500ms
 * Standard  - above 2500ms
 * VOD latency - content that was previously produced, is no longer live and is
   available indefinitely.
* Content encryption
* ABR between time-synced tracks - subscribers may switch between tracks
  at different quality levels in order to maximize visual or audio quality under
  conditions of throughput variability.
* Capable of delivering interstitial advertising.
* Logs and analytics management - support for the reporting of client-side QoE
   and relay delivery actions via publish tracks using {{MOQLOG}} and {{MOQMETRICS}}.

Initial versions of MSF will prioritize basic features necessary to exercise
interoperability across delivery systems. Later versions will add commercially
necessary features.

# Media packaging {#mediapackaging}
MSF delivers LOC {{LOC}} packaged media bitstreams.

## LOC packaging
This specification references Low Overhead Container (LOC) {{LOC}} to define how
audio and video content is packaged. With this packaging mode, each
EncodedAudioChunk or EncodedVideoChunk sample is placed in a separate MOQT
Object. Samples that belong to the same Group of Pictures (GOP) MUST be placed
within the same MOQT Group.

When LOC packaging is used for a track, the catalog packaging attribute
({{packaging}}) MUST be present and it MUST be populated with a value of "loc".

## Time-alignment {#timealignment}
MSF Tracks MAY be time-aligned. Those that are, are subject to the following
requirements:

* Tracks advertised in the catalog as belonging to a common alternate group MUST
  be time-aligned.
* The render duration of the first media object of each equally numbered MOQT
  Group, after decoding, SHOULD have overlapping presentation time.

A consequence of this restriction is that an MSF receiver SHOULD be able to
cleanly switch between time-aligned media tracks at group boundaries.

If time-aligned media tracks do not have overlapping presentation time at
equally-numbered group boundaries, then an alternate mechanism, not defined by
this specification, must be provided to the client to enable it to switch smoothly
between time-aligned, but numerically dissimilar, Group IDs.

## Content protection and encryption {#contentprotection}

MSF supports end-to-end encryption of media content using MoQ Secure Objects
{{SecureObjects}}. When encryption is enabled, the payload of LOC-packaged
media objects is encrypted and authenticated, while relays can still route
content based on unencrypted header information.

### Encryption scheme signaling

The encryption scheme and parameters are signaled in the catalog using the
following track-level fields:

* encryptionScheme {{encryptionscheme}} - identifies the encryption mechanism
* cipherSuite {{ciphersuite}} - specifies the AEAD algorithm
* keyId {{keyid}} - identifies the key material for decryption
* trackBaseKey {{trackbasekey}} - the base key material for this track

When the encryptionScheme field is present in a track definition, subscribers
MUST decrypt the object payload using the specified scheme before processing.

### Key management

The keyId and trackBaseKey values are obtained from an external key management
system and the mechanism for obtaining these values is out of scope for this
specification. Examples of key management systems include MLS-based key
distribution {{E2EE-MLS}} or other out-of-band key exchange mechanisms.

Depending on the key management mechanism in use, a keyId MAY be scoped to:

* A single track
* A single MoQ Session
* Multiple tracks across one or more MoQ sessions

Publishers and subscribers MUST use the same key management system and agree
on the keyId scope semantics for interoperable operation.

### Recommended encryption scheme

The RECOMMENDED encryption scheme for MSF is "moq-secure-objects".
Implementations supporting content encryption MUST implement the
"moq-secure-objects" scheme as defined in {{SecureObjects}}.

When using the "moq-secure-objects" scheme:

* The cipherSuite field MUST be present and set to a supported cipher suite value
* The keyId field MUST be present to identify the key material
* The trackBaseKey field MUST be present to provide the base key material

### Encrypted object structure

For LOC-packaged tracks with encryption enabled (see {{SecureObjects, Section 4}}):

* The immutable header extensions (including Group ID and Object ID) remain
  in plaintext and are authenticated
* The object payload is encrypted and authenticated using the specified cipher
* Private header extensions (type 0xA) are encrypted alongside the payload

# Catalog {#catalog}
A Catalog is an MOQT Track that provides information about the other tracks being
produced by a MSF publisher. A Catalog is used by MSF publishers for
advertising their output and for subscribers in consuming that output. The
payload of the Catalog object is opaque to Relays and can be end-to-end
encrypted. The Catalog provides the names and namespaces of the tracks being
produced, along with the relationship between tracks, properties of the tracks
that consumers may use for selection and any relevant initialization data. A
catalog track MAY reference other catalog tracks.

The top-level catalog track MUST have a case-sensitive Track Name of "catalog".

A catalog object MAY be independent of other catalog objects or it MAY represent
a delta update of a prior catalog object. The first catalog object published
within a new group MUST be independent and MUST provide a complete catalog that
does not require any prior catalog object for interpretation. Any catalog updates
that precede the first Object of the latest Group MUST be ignored.

A catalog object SHOULD be published only when the content of the catalog has changed,
or after a period of time has passed such that the catalog object might fall out of cache
in a delivery network.

The catalog track SHOULD have a higher publisher priority than all tracks described
within the catalog.

A subscriber to a catalog track SHOULD use a higher subscriber priority for the catalog
subscription than for any other concurrent subscriptions.

Each catalog update MUST be mapped to an MOQT Object. All catalog updates, both
independent and delta, MUST be mapped to MOQT sub-group 0. The first Object (with
Object ID 0) in any Group in a catalog track MUST hold an independent copy of the
catalog. All subsequent Objects within that Group (i.e Objects IDs >= 1) MUST hold
a delta update. As soon as an independent update is produced, it MUST be placed at the
start of a new Group.

Subscribers accessing the catalog MUST use SUBSCRIBE with a Joining FETCH
(offset = 0) in order to obtain the latest complete catalog along with all subsequent
catalog objects, including delta updates, that follow.

A catalog is a JSON {{JSON}} document, comprised of a series of mandatory and
optional fields. At a minimum, a catalog MUST provide all mandatory fields. Some
fields are conditional depending on the type of content carried. A producer MAY add
additional fields to the ones described in this draft. Custom field names MUST NOT
collide with field names described in this draft.

A parser MUST ignore fields it does not understand.

## Root Catalog Fields {#rootcatalogfield}

Table 1 lists the fields defined at the root of the catalog JSON object.

| Field                     |  Name                  |           Definition      |
|:==========================|:=======================|:==========================|
| MSF version               | version                | {{msfversion}}            |
| Generated at              | generatedAt            | {{generatedat}}           |
| Is Complete               | isComplete             | {{iscomplete}}            |
| Tracks                    | tracks                 | {{tracks}}                |
| Publish tracks            | publishTracks          | {{publishtracks}}         |
| Delta update              | deltaUpdate            | {{deltaupdate}}           |
| Initialization Data List  | initDataList           | {{initdatalist}}          |

### MSF version {#msfversion}
Required: Yes    JSON Type: String    Location: Root Catalog

Specifies the version of MSF referenced by this catalog. There is no guarantee
that future catalog versions are backwards compatible and field definitions and
interpretation may change between versions. A subscriber MUST NOT attempt to
parse a catalog version which it does not understand.

For usage against IETF Internet-Draft releases, follow the convention of specifying
the version as "draft-XX". For example "draft-03" refers to the -03 draft release.

### Generated at {#generatedat}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Root Catalog

The wallclock time at which this catalog instance was generated, expressed as the
number of milliseconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT).
This field SHOULD NOT be included if the isLive field is false.

### Is Complete {#iscomplete}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Boolean    Location: Root Catalog

A catalog-level indication that the broadcast is complete. This is a commitment that
all tracks are complete, no new tracks will be added to the catalog, and no new
content will be published on any track. Note that even if all individual tracks have
isLive {{islive}} set to FALSE, new tracks could still be added to the catalog until
isComplete is set to TRUE. This field MUST NOT be included if it is FALSE. This field
MUST NOT be removed from a catalog once it has been added.

### Tracks {#tracks}
Required: Yes    JSON Type: Array    Location: Root Catalog

An array of track objects {{trackobject}}.

### Publish tracks {#publishtracks}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Array    Location: Root Catalog

An array of publish track objects. Publish tracks define tracks to which the
subscriber can publish data, such as logs, metrics, or other QoE data. This enables
bi-directional communication where the subscriber acts as a publisher for specific
tracks. Each publish track object follows the same structure as a regular track
object {{trackobject}} but is used for the reverse direction of data flow.

### Delta update {#deltaupdate}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Array    Location: Root Catalog

An ordered Array of operation objects that specify changes to apply to the catalog.
If this field is present, the catalog represents a delta (or partial) update with
a restricted set of fields and special processing rules - see {{deltaupdates}}.
If this field is absent, the catalog is independent.

Operations are applied sequentially in the order they appear in the array.
Each operation object MUST contain an "op" field indicating the operation type,
and a "tracks" field containing an Array of track objects {{trackobject}}.
The following operation types are defined:

* "add" - Add new tracks that have not previously been declared. The value of
  the "tracks" field is an Array of track objects {{trackobject}}.

* "remove" - Remove tracks that have been previously declared. The value of
  the "tracks" field is an Array of track objects {{trackobject}}. Each track
  object MUST include a Track Name {{trackname}} field, MAY include a Track
  Namespace {{tracknamespace}} field, and MUST NOT hold any other fields.

* "clone" - Clone new tracks from previously declared tracks. The value of
  the "tracks" field is an Array of track objects {{trackobject}}. Each track
  object MUST include a Parent Name {{parentname}} field and MAY include a
  Parent namespace {{parentnamespace}} field. The cloned track inherits all
  attributes from the parent except the Track Name which MUST be new.
  Attributes redefined in the track object override inherited values.

* "update" - update a subset of fields within an existing track. The value of
  the "tracks" field is an Array of track objects {{trackobject}}. Each track
  object MUST include a Parent Name {{parentname}} field and MAY include a
  Parent namespace {{parentnamespace}} field. Attributes declared in the track
  object override existing values.

### Initialization Data List {#initdatalist}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Array    Location: Root Catalog

An array of initialization reference objects. Each initialization reference
object has the following fields:

* id : a string defining a reference to this initialization data which is unique
  within the scope of the catalog.
* type: as string defining the type of reference. This version of the specification
  defines the following allowed types:

| Type             |   Data field definition                        |
|:=================|:===============================================|
| inline           |  Base64 {{BASE64}} encoded initialization data |
| track-property   |  The Track property type in hex notation       |
| object-property  |  An Object property type in hex notation       |

* data: a string holding the init payload as defined by the type.

For both the track-property and object-property types, the initialization
data is serialized as raw binary data and carried in the value field of the
MSF_INITIALIZATION Object property {{initialization-object-property}} or the
MSF_INITIALIZATION Track property {{initialization-track-property}}.

The Initialization Data List, if present, MUST be located after the tracks array in
the root of the JSON catalog. The purpose of this is to improve the human readability
of the catalog tracks by moving the verbose init data towards the end of the document.

## Track Object Fields

Table 2 lists the fields defined within each track object.

| Field                   |  Name                  |           Definition      |

### Tracks object {#trackobject}

A track object is a JSON Object containing a collection of fields whose location
is specified in Table 2.

### Track namespace {#tracknamespace}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

The name space under which the track name is defined. See section 2.3 of
{{MoQTransport}}. The track namespace is optional. If it is not declared within
a track, then each track MUST inherit the namespace of the catalog track. A
namespace declared in a track object overrides any inherited name space.

### Track name {#trackname}
Required: Yes    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string defining the name of the track. See section 2.3 of {{MoQTransport}}.
Within the catalog, track names MUST be unique per namespace.

### Packaging {#packaging}
Required: Yes    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string defining the type of payload encapsulation. Allowed values are strings
as defined in Table 3.

| Name            |   Value        |      Reference             |
|:================|:===============|:===========================|
| LOC             | loc            | See RFC XXXX               |
| Media Timeline  | mediatimeline  | See {{mediatimelinetrack}} |
| Event Timeline  | eventtimeline  | See {{eventtimelinetrack}} |
| MoQ Log         | moqlog         | See {{MOQLOG}}             |
| MoQ Metrics     | moqmetrics     | See {{MOQMETRICS}}         |
| Catalog         | catalog        | See {{catalog}}            |

Table 3: Allowed packaging values

### Event timeline type {#eventtype}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A String defining the type & structure of the data contained within the data
field of the Event timeline track. Types are defined by the application provider
and are not centrally registered. Implementers are encouraged to use a unique
naming scheme, such as Reverse Domain Name Notation, where domain name components are listed in reverse order (e.g., "com.example.myeventtype"), to avoid naming collisions.
This field is required if the {{packaging}} value is "eventtimeline".
This field MUST NOT be used if the packaging value is not "eventtimeline".

### Track role {#trackrole}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string defining the role of content carried by the track. Specified roles
are described in Table 4. These role values are case-sensitive.

This role field MAY be used in conjunction with the Mimetype {{mimetype}} to
fully describe the content of the track.

|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

Custom roles MAY be used as long as they do not collide with the specified roles.

### Is Live {#islive}
Required: Yes    JSON Type: Boolean    Location: Track Object

A track-level indication of whether new Objects will be added to this specific track.
True if new Objects will be added to the track.
False if no new Objects will be added to the track. A False value is sent under two
possible conditions:
* the publisher of a previously live track has ended the track.
* the track is Video-On-Demand (VOD) and was never live.
A True value MUST never follow a False value.

### Target latency {#targetlatency}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

The target latency in milliseconds. Target latency is defined as the offset in
wallclock time between when content was encoded and when it is displayed to the
end user. For example, if a frame of video is encoded at 10:08:32.638 UTC and the
target latency is 5000, then that frame should be rendered to the end-user at
10:08:37.638 UTC. If isLive is FALSE, this field MUST be ignored. All tracks
belonging to the same render group MUST have identical target latencies. All tracks
belonging to the same alternate group MUST have identical target latencies. If this
field is absent from the track definition, and isLive is TRUE, then the player
MAY choose the latency with which it renders the content.

This property MUST NOT be present if the buffers {{buffers}} property
is present within a track definition.

### Buffers {#buffers}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Object   Location: Track Object

An object defining a set of target buffers. Buffer is defined as the duration of
media data that MUST be buffered before decoding commences. This is typically known
as a forward or jitter-buffer in a media player.Players with identical buffer lengths
are likely to be synchronized. The target buffer object has these keys:

* target : defines the target buffer in integer milliseconds. Players SHOULD attempt
  to stabilize playback at this value.
* min : defines the minimum buffer in milliseconds. Players SHOULD NOT operate below
  this value.
* max : defines the maximum buffer in milliseconds. Players SHOULD NOT operate above
  this value.

Keys are optional. Unknown keys in the target buffer object MUST be ignored.

If isLive is FALSE, this target buffer property MUST be ignored. All tracks
belonging to the same render group MUST have identical target buffers. All tracks
belonging to the same alternate group MUST have identical target buffers. If this
field is absent from the track definition, and isLive is TRUE, then the player
MAY choose the buffers with which it conducts playback.

This property MUST NOT be present if the target latency {{targetlatency}} property
is present within a track definition.

### Track label {#tracklabel}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string defining a human-readable label for the track. Examples might be
"Overhead camera view" or "Deutscher Kommentar". Note that the {{JSON}} spec
requires UTF-8 support by decoders.

### Render group {#rendergroup}

An integer specifying a group of tracks which are designed to be rendered
together. Tracks with the same group number SHOULD be rendered simultaneously
and are designed to accompany one another. A common example would be tying
together audio and video tracks.

### Alternate group {#altgroup}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

An integer specifying a group of tracks which are alternate versions of
one-another. Alternate tracks represent the same media content, but differ in
their selection properties. Alternate tracks MUST have matching media time
sequences. A subscriber typically subscribes to one track from a set of
tracks specifying the same alternate group number. A common example would be
a set video tracks of the same content offered in alternate bitrates.

### Initialization reference {#initref}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string pointing at the id field of an entry in the Initialization
Data List {{initdatalist}}.

### Dependencies {#dependencies}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Array    Location: Track Object

Certain tracks may depend on other tracks for decoding. Dependencies holds an
array of track names {{trackname}} on which the current track is dependent.
Since only the track name is signaled, the namespace of the dependencies is
assumed to match that of the track declaring the dependencies.

### Template {#template}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: Array    Location: Track Object

A media timeline template for tracks with fixed-duration segments. It specifies
the relationship between media time, MOQT Location, and wallclock time through
starting points and intervals. See {{mediatimelinetemplate}} for the complete
format specification, field definitions, and computation formulas.

Tracks that include a template field SHOULD NOT also have a separate media timeline
track, as the template provides equivalent functionality. Different tracks (e.g.,
audio and video) MAY have independent template values to accommodate different
group durations.

### Temporal ID {#temporalid}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

A number identifying the temporal layer/sub-layer encoding of the track,
starting with 0 for the base layer, and increasing by 1 for the next higher
temporal fidelity.

For LOC packaged content, the string codec registrations are defined in Section 3
and Section 4 of {{WEBCODECS-CODEC-REGISTRY}}.
This property MUST be specified for tracks which have an inherent codec
associated with them (e.g., audio and video tracks). It is not required for
raw data tracks or event streams.

### Mimetype {#mimetype}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string defining the mime type {{MIME}} of the track.

### Framerate {#framerate}

The number of time units that pass per second.

### Maximum Bitrate {#bitrate}
Required: Conditional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

A number defining the maximum bitrate of the track, expressed in bits per second.
This property MUST be specified for audio and video tracks.

### Average Bitrate {#averagebitrate}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

A number defining the average bitrate of the track, over the lifetime of the track,
expressed in bits per second.

### Maximum GOP Duration {#maximumgopduration}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

A number defining the maximum duration, expressed in milliseconds, between
successive independently decodable points (random access points) in the media
track. This property SHOULD only accompany video tracks.

### Maximum Group Duration {#maximumgroupduration}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

accompany tracks for which audio codecs are specified.

### Channel configuration {#channelconfiguration}
Required: Conditional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string specifying the audio channel configuration. A string is used in order
to provide the flexibility to describe complex channel configurations for
multi-channel and Next Generation Audio schemas. This property MUST accompany
tracks for which audio codecs are specified.

### Display width {#displaywidth}

the standard Tags for Identifying Languages as defined by {{LANG}}.

### Parent name {#parentname}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string defining the parent track name {{trackname}} to be cloned or updated.
This field MUST only be included inside a 'clone' or 'update' operation in a
delta update {{deltaupdate}}.

### Parent namespace {#parentnamespace}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string defining the parent track namespace {{tracknamespace}} to be cloned. This field
MUST only be included inside a 'clone' or 'update' operation in a delta update {{deltaupdate}}.
If this field is missing from a clone operation, then the namespace of the catalog is assumed.

### Track duration {#trackduration}
Required: Optional    JSON Type: Number    Location: Track Object

The duration of the track expressed in integer milliseconds. This field MUST NOT
be included if the isLive {{islive}} field value is true.

### Connection URI {#connectionuri}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string containing the MOQT connection endpoint URI for the publish track. When
specified, the subscriber MUST establish a new MOQT connection to this URI for
publishing the track data. If this field is absent, the subscriber SHOULD reuse
the existing MOQT connection that was used to receive the catalog.

The URI MUST be a valid MOQT endpoint URI as defined by {{MoQTransport}} (Section 3.1.1). Examples include
"moqt://logs.example.com:4443", "moqt://metrics.example.com:8443", or
"https://logs.example.com/moqt".

### Token {#token}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string containing an authentication token or credential for the track. For
publish tracks, this token authorizes the subscriber to publish data to the
specified track. The format and validation of the token is application-specific.

### Encryption scheme {#encryptionscheme}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string identifying the encryption scheme used to protect the track content.
The default and RECOMMENDED value is "moq-secure-objects" as defined in
{{SecureObjects}}. If this field is absent, the track content is unencrypted.

Table 5: Registered encryption schemes

| Name                |   Value              |      Reference                    |
|:====================|:=====================|:==================================|
| MoQ Secure Objects  | moq-secure-objects   | {{SecureObjects}}                 |

Custom encryption schemes MAY be used. Custom scheme names SHOULD use Reverse
Domain Name Notation to avoid collisions (e.g., "com.example.custom-encryption").

### Cipher suite {#ciphersuite}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string identifying the AEAD cipher suite used for encryption. This field
MUST be present when encryptionScheme is specified. For the "moq-secure-objects"
scheme, the following cipher suites are defined:

Table 6: Cipher suites for moq-secure-objects

| Name                       |   Value                      | Tag Size |
|:===========================|:=============================|:=========|
| AES-128-GCM-SHA256         | aes-128-gcm-sha256           | 128 bits |
| AES-256-GCM-SHA512         | aes-256-gcm-sha512           | 128 bits |
| AES-128-CTR-HMAC-SHA256-80 | aes-128-ctr-hmac-sha256-80   | 80 bits  |

Implementations MUST support "aes-128-gcm-sha256". Implementations SHOULD
support "aes-128-ctr-hmac-sha256-80" for scenarios requiring smaller
authentication tags.

### Key ID {#keyid}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A string identifying the key material used for encryption. This value is
transmitted in the Secure Object KID extension header as defined in
({{SecureObjects, Section 4.2}}) of each encrypted object.

The keyId and associated trackBaseKey are obtained from an external key
management system. The mechanism for obtaining these values is out of scope
for this specification. Examples include MLS-based key distribution
{{E2EE-MLS}} or other out-of-band key exchange mechanisms.

The scope of a keyId is determined by the key management system in use. A
keyId MAY be scoped to a single track, a single MSF session, or multiple
tracks and sessions. When multiple tracks share the same Key ID, they MAY
share the same base key material, though per-track keys are derived using
the track name as defined in ({{SecureObjects, Section 5}}).

### Track Base Key {#trackbasekey}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: String    Location: Track Object

A base64-encoded {{BASE64}} string containing the base key material for this
track, as defined in ({{SecureObjects, Section 5}}). This field works in
conjunction with keyId to provide the cryptographic material needed for
decryption. The trackBaseKey is obtained from the same key management system
that provides the keyId.

When present, this field contains the raw key material that, together with
the track name and other parameters defined in ({{SecureObjects, Section 5}}),
is used to derive the actual encryption keys. Publishers and subscribers MUST
use matching trackBaseKey values for successful decryption.

### Authorization Info {#authinfo}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: Object    Location: Track Object

An object indicating that authorization is required to access this track.
The presence of this field signals to subscribers that they must obtain
and present valid authorization tokens when subscribing to this track.

The keys of this object are authorization scheme identifiers. Registered
schemes are defined in Table 7. The values are scheme-specific configuration
objects defined by the referenced specifications.

Table 7: Registered Authorization Schemes

| Scheme           | Value          | Reference                              |
|:================|:===============|:======================================|
| Privacy Pass     | privacy-pass   | {{PrivacyPassAuth}}                    |
| CAT              | cat            | {{C4M}}                                |

Custom authorization schemes MAY be used. Custom scheme names MUST use a
unique naming convention, such as Reverse Domain Name Notation
(e.g., "com.example.custom-auth"), to avoid naming collisions.

Subscribers inspect the authInfo field to determine which authorization
scheme to use and then obtain tokens through out-of-band mechanisms.
The specific token format, acquisition process, and presentation method
are defined by the authorization scheme specification.

### Token Delivery via URI {#tokendelivery}

Tokens can be delivered to subscribers through the catalog request URI using
variable substitution. Fragment parameters (following the `#` character) are
processed client-side and can be substituted into catalog fields using the
variable substitution mechanism defined in {{variablesubstitution}}.

For example, given a URI:

    moqt://relay.example.com/live#namespace--name&token=XYZ789

A catalog with:

~~~json
"authInfo": {
  "cat": "%token%"
}
~~~

Would be resolved by the subscriber to include `"cat": "XYZ789"`, which is
then presented in control messages as specified by the authorization scheme.

### Accessibility {#accessibility}
Required: Optional   JSON Type: Array  Location: Track Object

An array of accessibility descriptors indicating accessibility features
embedded within the track. Each descriptor is a JSON Object containing:

* A required 'scheme' field (String) identifying the accessibility scheme.
* A required 'value' field (String) specifying the accessibility channels
  or features available.

Table 6: Registered accessibility schemes

| Scheme                             | Description                          |
|:===================================|:=====================================|
| urn:scte:dash:cc:cea-608:2015      | CEA-608 closed captions              |
| urn:scte:dash:cc:cea-708:2015      | CEA-708 closed captions              |

The 'value' field for CEA-608/708 schemes uses the format defined by
{{SCTE214-1}}, where caption service channels are specified as
semicolon-separated pairs of channel identifier and language code
(e.g., "CC1=eng;CC3=spa").

A subscriber MAY use this information to determine caption availability
and configure an appropriate caption decoder.

## Delta updates {#deltaupdates}
A catalog update might contain incremental changes. This is a useful property if
many tracks may be initially declared but then there are small changes to a
subset of tracks. The producer can issue a delta update to describe these changes.
Changes are described incrementally, meaning that a delta update can itself modify
a prior delta update.

A restricted set of operations are allowed with each delta update:
* Add a new track that has not previously been declared.
* Add a new track by cloning a previously declared track.
* Remove a track that has been previously declared.
* Update properties of a previously declared track.

The following rules are to be followed in constructing and processing delta updates:

* A delta update MUST include the Delta Update {{deltaupdate}} field with at
  least one operation and the generatedAt field {{generatedat}}. It MUST NOT
  include any other Root Catalog fields {{rootcatalogfield}}.
* Operations are applied sequentially in the order they appear in the deltaUpdate
  array. Each operation is applied to the target document; the resulting document
  becomes the target of the next operation. Evaluation continues until all
  operations are successfully applied.
* Producers that publish frequent delta updates SHOULD periodically publish a new
  independent catalog in a new MOQT Group in order to bound the amount of delta
  processing required for joining subscribers.

## Variable Substitution {#variablesubstitution}

Catalog field values MAY contain variables that are substituted at delivery time.
This mechanism enables a single cached catalog to be customized for each viewer,
supporting use cases such as personalized advertising, A/B watermarking, QoE
reporting endpoints, and logging identifiers.

### Variable Syntax {#variablesyntax}

Variables are denoted by enclosing the variable name in percent characters (`%`).
Variable names MUST consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive.

The percent character (`%`) MUST NOT appear in catalog field values except as
part of a variable reference. Literal percent characters are not permitted.

Variable values MUST consist only of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores,
and the at sign (`@`). Special characters including commas, semicolons, quotes,
ampersands, and other punctuation MUST NOT appear in variable values. This
restriction prevents injection attacks and ensures safe substitution into
catalog field values.

### Variable Resolution {#variableresolution}

Variables are resolved from the fragment identifier of the URI used to access
the catalog. The fragment identifier is the portion following the `#` character
and is processed entirely client-side, making it suitable for per-viewer
customization without affecting server-side caching.

Query parameters (following the `?` character) are reserved for server-side
processing and MUST NOT be used for variable substitution.

When a subscriber requests a catalog using a URI containing a fragment identifier,
the fragment is parsed as key-value pairs (using `&` as delimiter and `=` as
separator). Each key becomes available as a variable name, and the variable
is replaced with the corresponding value.

## Catalog Compression {#catalog-compression}

Catalogs can contain significant redundancy, particularly when initialization
data is included. To reduce payload size, catalog objects MAY be compressed
using the MSF_COMPRESSION property ({{compression-signaling}}). If all catalog
objects are compressed, the track property ({{compression-track-property}}) is
used. If only some catalog objects are compressed (for example, the complete
catalog is compressed while delta updates are not), the object property
({{compression-object-property}}) is used on each compressed object.

## Catalog Examples

The following section provides non-normative JSON examples of various catalogs
compliant with this draft.


### Time-aligned Audio/Video Tracks with single quality

This example shows a catalog for a media producer capable of sending 3
time-aligned video tracks for high definition, low definition and medium
definition video qualities, along with an audio track. In this example the
namespace is absent, which infers that each track must inherit the namespace
of the catalog.

  %resourceId% as a placeholder for the subscriber's unique resource identifier.
  The track name "4" indicates Warning level granularity.
* The log track uses the namespace format defined in {{MOQLOG}} with %resourceId%
  as a placeholder. The track name "6" indicates Informational level priority.
  This track establishes a separate connection to logs.example.com.
* Both tracks include authentication tokens for publishing authorization.
* The subscriber MUST replace %resourceId% with their actual resource identifier
  as defined in the respective specifications.

# Media transmission
The MOQT Groups and MOQT Objects need to be mapped to MOQT Streams. Irrespective
of the {{mediapackaging}} in place, each MOQT Object MUST be mapped to a new
MOQT Stream.

## Group numbering
Group IDs for a track MUST be unique and MUST increase monotonically. Within a
continuous publishing session, each subsequent Group ID SHOULD increase by 1.

When a publisher restarts (e.g., after connectivity loss or encoder restart), it
MUST ensure the new starting Group ID is greater than any previously published
Group ID for that track. One approach is to use the current wall clock time in
milliseconds since the Unix epoch as the starting Group ID.

If a publisher maintains state across a restart and knows the previous Group ID,
it SHOULD signal the gap using the MOQT Prior Group ID Gap Extension header.

## Object Numbering
Object ID MUST be zero for the first Object within a Group and then MUST increase
monotonically by one within that Group.

# Media Timeline track {#mediatimelinetrack}
The media timeline track provides data about the previously published Groups and their
relationship to wallclock time and media time. Media timeline tracks allow players to
seek to precise points behind the live head in a live broadcast, or for random access
in a VOD asset. Media timeline tracks are optional. Multiple media timeline tracks
can exist inside a catalog.

## Media Timeline track payload {#mediatimelinepayload}
A media timeline track is a JSON {{JSON}} document. This document MAY be compressed
using the MSF_COMPRESSION property ({{compression-signaling}}). The document
supports two formats: an explicit entry format and a template format. Publishers
MAY combine both formats in a single document.

### Explicit entry format {#explicitentryformat}
The explicit format contains an array of records. Each record consists of
an array of three required items, whose ordinal position defines their type:

* The first item holds the media presentation timestamp, expressed as a JSON Number.
  This value MUST match the media presentation timestamp, expressed as the floor in integral milliseconds, of the first media sample in the referenced Object. Implementers
  who require increased time precision can parse the retrieved media object itself.
* The second item holds the MOQT Location of the entry, defined as a tuple of the MOQT
  Group ID and MOQT Object ID, and expressed as a JSON Array of Numbers, where the
  first number is the Group ID and the second number is the Object ID.
* The third item holds the wallclock time at which the media was encoded, defined as
  the number of milliseconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970
  (midnight UTC/GMT) and expressed as a JSON Number. For VOD assets, or if the
  wallclock time is not known, the value SHOULD be 0.

An example media timeline is shown below:

~~~json
[
  [0, [0,0], 1759924158381],
  [2002, [1,0], 1759924160383],
  [4004, [2,0], 1759924162385],
  [6006, [3,0], 1759924164387],
  [8008, [4,0], 1759924166389]
]
~~~

## Media Timeline Catalog requirements
A media timeline track MUST carry a 'type' identifier in the Catalog with a value
of "mediatimeline". A media timeline track MUST carry a 'depends' attribute which
contains an array of all track names to which the media timeline track applies.
The mime-type of a media timeline track MUST be specified as "application/json".

## Media Timeline track updating
The publisher MUST publish an independent media timeline in the first MOQT Object
of each MOQT Group of a media timeline track. An independent media timeline object
MUST contain all media timeline records accumulated and accessible up to that point, allowing a
subscriber joining at any group boundary to receive the accessible timeline history.
The publisher MAY publish incremental updates in the second and subsequent Objects
within each Group. Incremental updates contain only new media timeline records since
the previous media timeline Object in that Group.

## Media Timeline Template {#mediatimelinetemplate}
When the relationship between media time, MOQT Location and wallclock time follows
a regular, predictable pattern, a media timeline template MAY be used instead of an
explicit media timeline track. The template approach is best suited for content with
fixed-duration segments, such as VOD assets or live broadcasts with constant segment
durations. For content with variable segment durations, the explicit media timeline
track ({{mediatimelinepayload}}) MUST be used instead.

### Template Format
A media timeline template is expressed as an inline track attribute using the
{{template}} field. The template is a JSON Array containing six mandatory values
in the following fixed order:

1. startMediaTime - The media presentation timestamp of the first entry, as
   defined for media timeline entries in {{explicitentryformat}}.
2. deltaMediaTime - The constant interval between media presentation timestamps,
   expressed as a JSON Number in milliseconds.
3. startLocation - The MOQT Location of the first entry, as defined for media
   timeline entries in {{explicitentryformat}}.
4. deltaLocation - The constant interval between MOQT Locations, expressed as a
   JSON Array of two Numbers where the first number is the Group ID delta and the
   second number is the Object ID delta.
5. startWallclock - The wallclock time of the first entry, as defined for media
   timeline entries in {{explicitentryformat}}. For VOD assets, or if the wallclock
   time is not known, the value SHOULD be 0.
6. deltaWallclock - The constant interval between wallclock times, expressed as a
   JSON Number in milliseconds. For VOD assets, or if the wallclock time is not
   known, the value SHOULD be 0.

All six values are mandatory and MUST appear in the specified order.

Clients compute entry values using the following formulas, where n is the
zero-based entry index:

~~~
mediaTime[n] = startMediaTime + (n * deltaMediaTime)
location[n] = [startLocation[0] + (n * deltaLocation[0]),
               startLocation[1] + (n * deltaLocation[1])]
wallclock[n] = startWallclock + (n * deltaWallclock)
~~~

An example template value is shown below:

~~~json
[0, 2002, [0, 0], [1, 0], 1759924158381, 2002]
~~~

This template indicates that the first entry has media time 0ms, location [0,0],
and wallclock time 1759924158381. Each subsequent entry increments media time by
2002ms, location by [1,0] (next group, same object), and wallclock by 2002ms.

### Template Immutability
Unlike the explicit media timeline track, the media timeline template is intended
to be immutable once publishing starts. Publishers MUST NOT change the template
values for a track after the first Object has been published.

# Event Timeline track {#eventtimelinetrack}
The event timeline track provides a mechanism to associate ad-hoc event metadata with
the broadcast. Use-case examples include live sports score data, GPS coordinates of race
cars, SAP-types for media segments or active speaker notifications in web conferences.

To allow the client to bind this event metadata with the broadcast content described by
the media timeline track, each event record MUST contain a reference to one of
Media PTS, wallclock time or MOQT Location.

Event timeline tracks are optional. Multiple event timeline tracks can exist inside a
catalog. The type & structure of the data contained within each event timeline track is
declared in the catalog, to facilitate client selection and parsing.

Event timeline tracks can be present in both the 'tracks' and 'publishtracks' arrays,
implying that can be both consumed and produced by an endpoint. 

## Event Timeline data format {#eventtimelineformat}
An event timeline track is a JSON {{JSON}} document. This document MAY be compressed
using the MSF_COMPRESSION property ({{compression-signaling}}). The document
contains an array of records. Each record consists of a JSON Object containing
the following required fields:

* An index reference, which MUST be either 'T' for wallclock time, 'L' for Location or
  'M' for Media PTS. Only one of these index values may be used within each record. Event
  timelines SHOULD use the same index reference type for each record. The definitions for
  wallclock time, Location and Media PTS are identical to those defined for media timeline
  payload {{mediatimelinepayload}}. Wallclock time and media PTS values are JSON Number,
  while Location value is an Array of Numbers, where the first item represents the MOQT
  GroupID and the second item the MOQT Object ID.
* A 'data' Object, whose structure is defined by the {{eventtype}} value declared for this
  track in the Catalog.

## Event Timeline Catalog requirements
An event timeline track MUST carry:

* a 'packaging' {{packaging}} attribute with a value of "eventtimeline".
* an 'eventType' {{eventtype}} attribute declaring the type & structure of data contained in the
  event timeline track.

If an event timeline track is a dependency for other tracks, then it SHOULD carry a 'depends'
{{dependencies}} attribute referencing each of the tracks for which it is a dependency. 

## Event Timeline track updating
The mapping of Event Timeline payloads to MOQT Groups is defined by the 'eventType'.

If the data in the event timeline track is to be consumed as a sequence, then the
the publisher SHOULD publish an independent event timeline in the first MOQT Object
of each MOQT Group of an event timeline track. An independent event timeline object
SHOULD contain all event timeline records accumulated and accessible up to that point, allowing a
subscriber joining at any group boundary to receive the accessible event history.
The publisher MAY publish incremental updates in the second and subsequent Objects
within each Group. Incremental updates contain only new event timeline records since
the previous event timeline Object in that Group.

If the data in the event timeline track is independent of its history, then the
publisher SHOULD publish each record in its own MOQT Group and use a single MOQT Object
per MOQT Group.

# Log track {#logtrack}

Log tracks provide a mechanism for subscribers to publish diagnostic and
operational log data back to the delivery system. This enables QoE monitoring,
debugging, and analytics collection. Log tracks are defined in the catalog's
publishTracks array with a packaging value of "moqlog".

## Log track payload {#logpayload}

The log track payload format is defined in {{MOQLOG}}. Each MOQT Object contains
a single JSON-formatted log entry. The log entry structure includes optional fields
such as severity, timestamp, hostname, application name, process ID, message ID,
and the log message itself. Additional structured data fields support distributed
tracing integration with TraceID, SpanID, and InstrumentationScope aligned with
OpenTelemetry specifications. Implementations MUST follow the object payload
format specified in Section 4 of {{MOQLOG}}.

## Log track namespace and name {#logtrackname}

TODO: Finalize on track naming

Log tracks MUST use the namespace and track name format defined in Section 3
of {{MOQLOG}}. The Track Namespace consists of the tuples:
`(moq://moq-syslog.arpa/logs-v1/),(resourceID)` where resourceID is a unique
identifier for the publishing resource.

The Track Name is a single byte containing the log priority level in binary.
Priority levels range from 0 (Emergency) to 7 (Debug), following syslog severity
conventions.

## Log track Group ID and Object ID {#loggroupobject}

The Group ID represents the timestamp at which the log entry was captured,
truncated to a 62-bit binary integer representing microseconds since the Unix epoch.
This allows log entries to be naturally ordered by time within the MOQT object model.

The Object ID is set to zero for a log entry unless multiple log messages occur
within the same microsecond, in which case the Object ID increments to distinguish
between messages captured at the same timestamp.

## Log track catalog requirements

A log track MUST be declared in the publishTracks array of the catalog with:

* a {{packaging}} attribute with a value of "moqlog".
* a {{trackrole}} attribute with a value of "log".

A log track MAY include:

* a {{connectionuri}} attribute if logs should be published to a different endpoint.
* a {{token}} attribute for publish authorization.


# Metrics track {#metricstrack}

Metrics tracks provide a mechanism for subscribers to publish quantitative
measurements back to the delivery system. This enables QoE analytics, performance
monitoring, and operational dashboards. Metrics tracks are defined in the catalog's
publishTracks array with a packaging value of "moqmetrics".

## Metrics track payload {#metricspayload}

The metrics track payload format is defined in {{MOQMETRICS}}. The data model
consists of Resources (systems generating metrics identified by ResourceID),
optional Attributes (dimensional key-value pairs), and Metrics (named measurements
with timeseries values).

{{MOQMETRICS}} defines two metric value types - Gauge and Counter.
Both value types support either 64-bit floating point or integer representation.
Implementations MUST follow the object payload format specified in Section 3
of {{MOQMETRICS}}.

## Metrics track namespace and name {#metricstrackname}

TODO: Finalize the track naming.

Metrics tracks MUST use the namespace and track name format defined in Section 3
 of {{MOQMETRICS}}. The Track Namespace consists of the tuples:
`(moq://metrics.moq.arpa/v1/),(resourceID)` where resourceID is a unique identifier
for the publishing resource.

The Track Name identifies the granularity level for the metrics being published,
specified as a single tuple `(<granularity-level>)` where granularity-level is a
value from 0 (Emergency) to 7 (Debug). Higher priority levels (lower numbers)
indicate more critical metrics that should always be reported.

## Metrics track Group ID and Object ID {#metricsgroupobject}

The Group ID represents the capture time as the number of milliseconds since
January 1, 1970 (Unix epoch). This allows metrics to be naturally grouped and
ordered by their capture timestamp within the MOQT object model.

Within each Group, Object IDs are assigned as follows:

* **Object ID 0**: Contains the capture timestamp as Unix epoch time in nanoseconds,
  along with any optional attributes for the metrics in this group.
* **Object ID 1 and above**: Each subsequent Object contains an individual metric
  as a name-value pair.

This structure allows a single capture event to include multiple metrics while
maintaining efficient MOQT caching and distribution.

## Metrics track catalog requirements

A metrics track MUST be declared in the publishTracks array of the catalog with:

* a {{packaging}} attribute with a value of "moqmetrics".
* a {{trackrole}} attribute with a value of "metrics".

A metrics track MAY include:

* a {{connectionuri}} attribute if metrics should be published to a different endpoint.
* a {{token}} attribute for publish authorization.

## Well-known event timeline types {#wellknowneventtypes}

Event timelines can carry various types of broadcast metadata synchronized
with media content. The "MSF Event Timeline Types" registry
({{iana-event-timeline-types}}) maintains a list of well-known event types.
Publishers SHOULD use registered types when applicable to ensure
interoperability.

Event timelines can carry data types including but not limited to:

* Ad insertion signaling (e.g., SCTE-35 splice points) - see {{SCTE35-MSF}}
* Out-of-band timed-text cues (WebVTT, IMSC1) - see {{WebVTT-MSF}} and {{IMSC1-MSF}}
* Sports scores and game state
* GPS coordinates and telemetry
* Active speaker notifications
* Custom application-specific metadata

The packaging format and data structure for each event type is defined by
the specification referenced in the registry. Custom event types not in
the registry SHOULD use Reverse Domain Name Notation (e.g.,
"com.example.myeventtype") to avoid naming collisions.

# Workflow

## URL construction and interpretation

An MSF URL identifies a MOQT session and an optional sub-resource within that session.
It inherits the MOQT URI scheme defined in {{MoQTransport}} and extends it to add a
fragment definition, which defines the type, the namespace and name of the track along
with optional key-value attributes.

~~~ abnf
; MSF URI Definition
; The following rules are imported from RFC 3986:
;   authority    (Section 3.2)
;   path-abempty (Section 3.3)
;   query        (Section 3.4)

msf-uri = "moqt://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] "#" msf-fragment
~~~

The MOQT specification carries the normative definition of these components,
along with processing instructions. They are repeated here for clarity. In the event of
any conflict, the definition in {{MoQTransport}} is authoritative.

* Scheme: This case-insensitive scheme defines the underlying transport. The client may
  use either a WebTransport or native QUIC connection. A moqt URI can be converted to an
  https URI by replacing the scheme, so the path-abempty and query components use the
  same syntax as https URIs.
* Authority: Required. Contains the host and optional port (defaulting to 443).
  This information is used by the client to establish the transport session.
* Path: Optional. If present, it provides server-specific configuration or routing
  information used during connection initialization.
* Query: Optional. Contains key-value parameters separated by &. If the query is absent,
  the ? separator MUST be omitted. Query arguments are intended for the server and
  SHOULD be ignored by the client.

This specification registers a fragment type of "msf" in the "MOQT URI Fragment Types"
registry established by {{MoQTransport}} (see {{IANA}}). This type is required for any
URL defining an MSF resource. The value of this type is the msf-fragment-value.

The msf-fragment is defined by the following ABNF:

~~~ abnf
; MSF Fragment Definition
; The following rules are imported from RFC 3986:
;   pchar        (Section 3.3)
;   unreserved   (Section 2.3)
;   pct-encoded  (Section 2.1)
;   sub-delims   (Section 2.2)

msf-fragment      = "msf:" msf-fragment-value

msf-fragment-value = track-identifier [ "&" parameter-list ]

track-identifier  = 1*( pchar-no-amp / "/" )
                    ; MSF namespace-name string
                    ; MUST NOT contain '&' or '?'
                    ; '?' MUST be percent-encoded as %3F within this component

parameter-list    = parameter *( "&" parameter )

parameter         = param-name "=" param-value

param-name        = 1*( pchar-no-amp / "/" )

param-value       = *( pchar-no-amp / "/" )

; Derived from RFC 3986 pchar (Section 3.3), excluding '&' and '?':
;   pchar = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / ":" / "@"
; '&' is excluded as it serves as the MSF fragment component delimiter.
; '?' is excluded to avoid ambiguity with the URI query component delimiter.
pchar-no-amp      = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims-no-amp / ":" / "@"

; Derived from RFC 3986 sub-delims (Section 2.2), excluding '&':
;   sub-delims = "!" / "$" / "&" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
sub-delims-no-amp = "!" / "$" / "'" / "(" / ")" / "*" / "+" / "," / ";" / "="
~~~

The msf-fragment-value identifies a specific Track. The track-identifier MUST be
formatted as an MSF namespace-name string (see {{namespacenameencoding}}). The client
uses this identifier to initiate a SUBSCRIBE or FETCH command once the transport session
is established. The namespace-name string MAY be followed by a series of key-value
parameters, each separated from the preceding element by &. These key-value parameters
are intended for processing by the client and, being part of the fragment, are not transferred
to the server at connection time. Certain of the fragment key-value parameters have a reserved
meaning, as defined by {{reservedfragmentparameters}}.

### Reserved fragment parameters {#reservedfragmentparameters}

Table 8 defines reserved key names for the parameter portion of the msf-fragment. Keynames are
case-sensitive.

| Name            |                Description                       |
|:================|:=================================================|
| wallclock-range | A subclip defined by a wallclock time range      |
| mediatime-range | A subclip defined by a media time range          |
| location-range  | A subclip defined by a MOQT Location range       |
| c4m             | A base64 encoded C4M token                       |
| connection      | Mandates a connection type                       |

* wallclock-range - a range defined by start and end wallclock times, each expressed
  as milliseconds since Unix Epoch and separated by a "-" dash. The dash and end
  time MAY be omitted to indicate an open range. The range definition is inclusive.
* mediatime-range - a range defined by start and end media times, each expressed
  as milliseconds and separated by a "-" dash. The dash and end time MAY be omitted
  to indicate an open range. The range definition is inclusive.
* location-range - a range defined by start and end media MOQT Location separated by
  a "-" dash. Range definitions are inclusive. MOQT Location is expressed as Group ID
  and Object ID separated by a "." dot. End Location may be omitted to indicate an
  open range which continues to the end of the content.  End Object ID may be omitted,
  indicating the whole end group is included in the range. The "." dot and "-" dash
  separators MUST be omitted when the second value is omitted.
* c4m - a base64 encoded token, as defined by {{C4M}}.
* connection - mandates the client to use a particular connection type when connecting to
  the server. There are two allowed values - "q" or "wt". "q" indicates that a Native QUIC
  connection MUST be used. "wt" indicates that a WebTransport connection MUST be used.

If multiple ranges are specified within the same URL for the same parameter, the client MUST
process the union of those ranges.

Example fragment parameters:

* connection=q
* connection=wt
* wallclock-range=1761759637565-1761759836189
* wallclock-range=1761751753894
* mediatime-range=0-13421
* mediatime-range=982
* location-range=34.0-2145.16
* location-range=16.24 (open range starting at Group ID 16 Object ID 24)
* location-range=16-24 (range from Group ID 16 through to and including all Objects in Group ID 24)
* c4m=gqhkYWxnIGVzaGFyqGR0eXBNhdZ9hdWQAY3VybGZlbWlzcwZleWV2aW5uZWlhdGVwQWNyZW5lY

### MSF Namespace-Name String Encoding {#namespacenameencoding}

To represent MoQ Tuples (which are sequences of byte strings) within the URL
fragment, MSF uses a specific encoding convention, which is normatively defined by
MOQT {{MoQTransport}} and repeated here for convenience:

* Hierarchy: Each element of the Namespace tuple is rendered in order, separated by
  a single hyphen (-).
* Delimiter: The Track Name is appended to the end, separated from the namespace by
  a double hyphen (--).
* Character Escaping:
    * Unreserved characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _) are represented literally.
    * All other byte values (including hyphens and periods used as data) MUST be
      percent-encoded using a period (.) followed by two lowercase hexadecimal digits
      (e.g., a literal hyphen in a name becomes .2d).

Note: This encoding ensures that the structural delimiters (- and --) remain unambiguous.

### Example MSF URLs

* URL pointing at a catalog track (either WebTransport or native QUIC may be used):
  moqt://example.com/server/config?a=1&b=2#msf:customer-livestream-123--catalog
    * Session: example.com/server/config?a=1&b=2
    * Streaming format type: msf
    * Namespace: ('customer', 'livestream', '123')
    * Track Name: 'catalog'

* URL with a required raw QUIC connection pointing at a catalog:
  moqt://example.com/relay-app/relayID#msf:customerID-broadcastID--catalog&connection=q

* URL pointing at a non-catalog track, with a required WebTransport connection
  moqt://example.com/relay-app/relayID#msf:customerID-broadcastID--video&connection=wt

* URL pointing at a subclip:

## Initiating a broadcast
An MSF publisher MUST publish a catalog track object before publishing any media
track objects.

## Ending a live broadcast
After publishing a catalog and defining tracks carrying live content, an original
publisher can deliver a deterministic signal to all subscribers that the broadcast
is complete by taking the following steps:

* Send a SUBSCRIBE_DONE (See MOQT Section 8.1.2) message for all active tracks using
  status code 0x2 Track Ended.
* If the live stream is being converted instantly to a VOD asset, then publish an
  independent (non-delta) catalog update which, for each track, sets isLive {{islive}}
  to FALSE and adds a track duration {{trackduration}} field.
* If the live stream is being terminated permanently without conversion to VOD, then
  publish an independent catalog update which signals isComplete {{iscomplete}} as
  TRUE and which contains an empty Tracks {{tracks}} field.

## Authorization {#authorization}

MSF supports token-based authorization through pluggable authentication schemes.
Both original publishers and end subscribers can independently acquire authorization
tokens and present them to relays. Relays use these tokens to authorize whether
an end subscriber is permitted to setup the connection, as well as to receive content
and/or to send content.

### Discovering Authorization Requirements

End subscribers discover authorization requirements by parsing the catalog.
For each track of interest, examine the `authInfo` field. If present, the
track requires authorization and the subscriber must obtain appropriate
credentials for one of the schemes listed in the field.

Original publishers and end subscribers may obtain authorization tokens from
multiple sources, including out-of-band provisioning or as a parameter in
the connection URI. These tokens can be presented either in the connection
setup message (CLIENT_SETUP) or in control messages (SUBSCRIBE, FETCH, PUBLISH,
PUBLISH_NAMESPACE) as described in {{presentingauthorization}}.

### Token Acquisition

Token acquisition is out of scope for this specification. Both original publishers
and end subscribers independently obtain tokens through mechanisms such as:

* Direct authentication with a distribution service
* OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect flows
* Out-of-band provisioning

The token acquisition endpoint and flow depend on the authorization scheme
and deployment configuration. Original publishers and end subscribers MAY
use the same or different authorization services depending on the deployment.

Tokens MAY also be supplied as parameters in the connection URI. When a
connection URI contains token parameters, the subscriber extracts the token
value and includes it in the appropriate MOQT message. For example:

~~~
moqt://relay.example.com/moqt#namespace--name&token=eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSJ9...
~~~

URI parameters provide a convenient mechanism for distributing pre-authorized
playback links. The parameter name and format are deployment-specific.

### Presenting Authorization {#presentingauthorization}

Once tokens are obtained, both original publishers and end subscribers present
them to relays according to the scheme specification. Tokens MAY be presented
in the SETUP message (CLIENT_SETUP or SERVER_SETUP) using the AUTHORIZATION
TOKEN setup parameter, or in individual control messages using the
AUTHORIZATION TOKEN message parameter.

When a token is associated with a track, it MUST be included in ALL control
messages that accept the AUTHORIZATION TOKEN parameter and are associated
with that track. For end subscribers, this includes SUBSCRIBE, SUBSCRIBE_NAMESPACE,
FETCH, and REQUEST_UPDATE messages. For original publishers, this includes
PUBLISH and PUBLISH_NAMESPACE messages. This requirement applies regardless
of whether the token was also provided in SETUP.

### Handling Authorization Failures

When a relay rejects an authorization token, subscribers SHOULD handle the
failure gracefully:

* If a SUBSCRIBE or FETCH request is rejected due to invalid or expired
  authorization, the subscriber MAY attempt to obtain a fresh token and
  retry the request.

* If a token is rejected due to insufficient scope, the subscriber SHOULD
  NOT retry with the same token.

* For interactive applications, subscribers MAY prompt users to
  re-authenticate when authorization fails.

* Subscribers SHOULD implement exponential backoff when retrying failed
  authorization attempts to avoid overwhelming the relay or token issuer.

The specific error codes and retry semantics are defined by the authorization
scheme specifications. See {{PrivacyPassAuth}} for Privacy Pass error handling
and {{C4M}} for CAT error handling.

# MSF Properties {#track-properties}

MSF defines MOQT Track Properties and Object Properties (see {{MoQTransport}})
to signal metadata about MSF tracks and objects. These properties are carried in
MOQT control messages and object headers, allowing endpoints to learn track and
object characteristics before processing payload data.

## Compression Signaling {#compression-signaling}

MSF provides two mutually exclusive mechanisms to signal compression of
track payloads, including catalogs ({{catalog}}), media timeline tracks
({{mediatimelinetrack}}), and event timeline tracks ({{eventtimelinetrack}}).
Publishers MUST use one of the following approaches:

* **Track Property** ({{compression-track-property}}): Signals that ALL objects
  in the track are compressed using the specified algorithm.
* **Object Property** ({{compression-object-property}}): Signals compression on
  individual objects, allowing a mixture of compressed and uncompressed objects
  within the same track.

A publisher MUST NOT use both mechanisms on the same track. If the track property
is set, then every object in the track is compressed and the object property
MUST NOT be present. If compression varies between objects, then the track
property MUST NOT be set and the object property MUST be used on each
compressed object.

The compression algorithm values used by both mechanisms are:

| Value | Compression Algorithm | Reference |
|:======|:======================|:==========|
| 0     | None (uncompressed)   | RFC XXXX  |
| 1     | GZIP                  | {{GZIP}}  |

Table: MSF Compression Values

All MSF implementations MUST support both uncompressed payloads (value 0 or
property absent) and GZIP compressed payloads (value 1).

### MSF_COMPRESSION Track Property {#compression-track-property}

Track Property type: 0x78

The MSF_COMPRESSION track property signals that ALL objects in the track are
compressed using the specified algorithm. This mechanism is appropriate when
every object published on the track uses the same compression.

If used, publishers MUST include the MSF_COMPRESSION track property in the PUBLISH
message (publisher-initiated flow) or SUBSCRIBE_OK (subscriber-initiated flow).

Subscribers MUST check for this property in the corresponding message before
processing the track payload.

If the property is absent, and no per-object compression is signaled, the
subscriber MUST treat the payload as uncompressed. If the property is present
with a value the subscriber does not support, the subscriber MUST NOT attempt
to process the payload and SHOULD unsubscribe from the track.

### MSF_COMPRESSION Object Property {#compression-object-property}

Object Property type: 0x78

The MSF_COMPRESSION object property signals that an individual object is
compressed. This mechanism is appropriate when a track contains a mixture of
compressed and uncompressed objects. For example, a catalog track where the
first object in a group (the complete catalog) is compressed, but subsequent
delta update objects within the same group are uncompressed.

If used, publishers MUST include the MSF_COMPRESSION object property on each
compressed object.

Subscribers MUST check for this property on each received object before
processing its payload. If the property is absent on an object, the subscriber
MUST treat that object's payload as uncompressed. If the property is present
with a value the subscriber does not support, the subscriber MUST NOT attempt
to process that object.

## Initialization properties

MSF provides two mechanisms for signalling initialization data using properties.

### MSF_INITIALIZATION Track property {#initialization-track-property}

Track Property type: 0x79

The MSF_INITIALIZATION Track property carries the initialization data for the track.
This initialization data is immutable over the life of the track.

Tracks which choose to transmit initialization data using this property MUST include
an initRef {{initref}} field referencing an Initialization Data List {{initdatalist}}
entry with a type of 'track-property'.

If used, publishers MUST include the MSF_INITIALIZATION  track property in the PUBLISH
message (publisher-initiated flow) or SUBSCRIBE_OK message (subscriber-initiated flow).

### MSF_INITIALIZATION Object property {#initialization-object-property}

Object Property type: 0x79

The MSF_INITIALIZATION Object property carries initialization data for the track, when
that initializaiton data might change over the life of the track. Since subscription
might occur at any time, this property needs to be repeated. Publishers SHOULD add this
property to the first Object in each Group.

Tracks which choose to transmit initialization data using this property MUST include
an initRef {{initref}} field referencing an Initialization Data List {{initdatalist}}
entry with a type of 'object-property'.
